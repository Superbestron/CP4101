# CP4101 - FYP

This project aims to develop a heterogeneous computing cluster to accelerate large-scale applications. The computing cluster will consist of multiple nodes, each having CPU, GPU, and FPGA devices. The main objective of this project is to determine the specific scenarios in which GPUs outperform FPGAs and vice versa for Sparse Matrix Dense Matrix Multiplication (SpMM). If any shortcomings are identified in the performance comparison between the two, the goal is to find and implement solutions to address these shortcomings. The developed infrastructure can then be used to accelerate large-scale applications simultaneously on multiple heterogeneous compute elements based on their specific characteristics, ultimately leading to improved performance and power efficiency. <br><br>
